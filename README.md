Clarke's Helper Library (work-in-progress)

This repository is intended to provide various helper classes to aid in development of applications with the [JUCE C++ framework](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE). The [JUCE module format](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE/blob/master/modules/JUCE%20Module%20Format.txt) is used for easy integration into projects generated with the ProJucer.
